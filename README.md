Check out the original library for more details.

We edited this library in several locations to allow us to use PASCAL VOC dataset and also have images that are input as 224x224 instead of 416x416.

In order to use our version, either clone or download it to your local computer and then run:
```

yarn build
yarn link


```

Then navigate yourself to the folder with the main website and run


```
yarn link tfjs-yolo-tiny

```


and then you should be ready to either serve the website or build it.
